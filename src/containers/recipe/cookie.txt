Ingredients
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 chocolate chips, 1/2 (1 stick) softened unsalted butter & granulated sugar & packed light brown sugar, 1/4 chopped nuts (optional), 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract & baking soda, 1/4 salt, 1 large egg

Preparation
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips and optional chopped nuts.

Baking
Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until the edges turn a golden brown color. The centers will still be slightly soft.

Enjoying
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Indulge in these exquisitely delicious chocolate chip cookies, savoring every delightful bite!
